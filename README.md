# MyEventBoard

MyEventBoard is a scheduling web application currently being developed by Tommy Liao, Simon Louie and Blaise Takushi, 
as part of the Schedule It! project.

## Accessing the Application

While MyEventBoard is currently in development, it can be accessed at  
https://myeventboard.herokuapp.com/

## Setting Up the Repository for Development

For the project to be functional, it should be cloned into the 'public_html' folder in your engineering filespace.  
There are two things to install. Run the Bash shell scripts to install Composer and Twig.  
Install Composer first, and then install Twig.

Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. Visit https://getcomposer.org/ for more information.  
Twig is a templating engine for PHP. Documentation is available at https://twig.symfony.com/doc/1.x/

Remember to also set permissions for everything inside the repository.  
While inside the 'public_html' folder, run 'chmod -R 755 MyEventBoard/'.
