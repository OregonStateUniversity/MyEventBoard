# Tests

## PHPUnit

We use PHPUnit for unit tests. Test files should be saved in the `tests` folder. Test file names should be in Pascal case suffixed with `Test`. The class name of the test should match the file name.

To run all unit tests, run this command in the root directory of this project:

```
./tests-php.sh
```
