* Could make sense to make separate PHPs, but want to make them the same routes

Routes:
/MyEventBoard/create.php => /MyEventBoard/scheduleit/meetings/create
/MyEventBoard/dashboard.php => /MyEventBoard/scheduleit/meetings
/MyEventBoard/edit.php?key={key} => /MyEventBoard/scheduleit/meetings/{meeting_id}/edit**
/MyEventBoard/events.php => /MyEventBoard/scheduleit/meetings
/MyEventBoard/index.php => /MyEventBoard/scheduleit
/MyEventBoard/login.php => /MyEventBoard/scheduleit/login
/MyEventBoard/logout.php => /MyEventBoard/scheduleit/logout
/MyEventBoard/manage.php => /MyEventBoard/scheduleit/manage
/MyEventBoard/register.php?key={key} => /MyEventBoard/scheduleit/meetings/{meeting_id}/invite**
/MyEventBoard/reservation_details.php?key={key} => /MyEventBoard/scheduleit/meetings/{meeting_id}**
/MyEventBoard/reservations.php => /MyEventBoard/scheduleit/meetings

** Can still incorporate a key query param
